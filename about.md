## Career & Qualifications

Since obtaining his Bachelor of Science, double majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics and graduating with Distinction, he has worked at companies ranging startups to multinational technology verticals, working on teams of varying size ranging from being the sole developer to teams of 20+ people spanning multiple continents.

He is a programming polyglot, with various levels of professional experience in C, C++, Python, C#, Java, Javacript, Objective-C, Fortran, Maple, CUDA, and x86 Assembly. He has developed for Linux and Microsoft Windows, for desktop and for the web. His preference is for developing in Python, running on Linux and dropping down to C++ for performance critical components, with Cython acting as the glue.

Adam naturally has a predilection for working on projects which require the application of his mathematical skills to break down real world problems, before proceeding to turn it all in to ones and zeros. However he is also well experienced in principled approaches to software design, and in writing robust, elegant, and maintainable software.

As a strong believer in life-long learning, his interest post-graduation has been fervently captured by the field of machine learning, and in particular with probabilistic methods.

Adam has contributed to multiple open source projects (including Django). He prefers to leverage open source libraries and development tools wherever possible, and is convinced that contributing back any fixes or enhancements to such projects is of net value to all involved.

Adam is available for consulting projects on a part-time basis. His rates vary based on the project type, problem domain, and expected length/frequency. If you have something for which you think he would be suited, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@chidlow.net) with a short description of your work proposal to discuss options.

## Bio

Adam first fell in love with mathematics at the age of 10 after being given some old University textbooks to use as door stops, one of which was "Calculus, Vol. 1" by Apostol, which he started reading and thought was the coolest thing ever. He became similarly enamoured with programming at a young age, and was (and still is) particularly excited at the intersection between the two, even implementing a simple Computer Algebra System to do some of his more tedious math homework for him in high school.

He had a hard time choosing between continuing his studies after being accepted to do his honours year, or taking a an offer of full time employment to work in the exciting & challenging domain of mine planning and optimisation software. One day he hopes to be able to return to his studies and obtain a Ph.D in Computer Science or Mathematics.

His favourite theorem is GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem.

In what little free time he has, he enjoys reading (mostly speculative fiction), power-lifting, and amateur astronomy.

## Technologies & Processes

Adam is confident in his ability to pick up any new language or skill required on the job in a very short amount of time. However he recognises the need sometimes to have someone with in-depth experience in a particular technology who can hit the ground running, so has broken up his experience by degree of experience.
